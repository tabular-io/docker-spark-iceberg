# Spark + Iceberg Quickstart Image

This is a docker compose environment to quickly get up and running with a Spark environment and a local REST
catalog, and MinIO as a storage backend.

**note**: If you don't have docker installed, you can head over to the [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
page for installation instructions.

## Usage
Start up the notebook server by running the following.
```
docker-compose up
```

The notebook server will then be available at http://localhost:8888

While the notebook server is running, you can use any of the following commands if you prefer to use spark-shell, spark-sql, or pyspark.
```
docker exec -it spark-iceberg spark-shell
```
```
docker exec -it spark-iceberg spark-sql
```
```
docker exec -it spark-iceberg pyspark
```

To stop everything, just run `docker-compose down`.

## Troubleshooting & Maintenance

### Refreshing Docker Image

The prebuilt spark image is uploaded to Dockerhub. Out of convenience, the image tag defaults to `latest`.

If you have an older version of the image, you might need to remove it to upgrade.
```bash
docker image rm tabulario/spark-iceberg && docker-compose pull
```

### Building the Docker Image locally

If you want to make changes to the local files, and test them out, you can build the image locally and use that instead:

```bash
docker image rm tabulario/spark-iceberg && docker-compose build
```

### Use `Dockerfile` In This Repo

To directly use the Dockerfile in this repo (as opposed to pulling the pre-build `tabulario/spark-iceberg` image), you can use `docker-compose build`.

### Deploying Changes

To deploy changes to the hosted docker image `tabulario/spark-iceberg`, run the following. (Requires access to the tabulario docker hub account)

```sh
cd spark
docker buildx build -t tabulario/spark-iceberg --platform=linux/amd64,linux/arm64 . --push
```
